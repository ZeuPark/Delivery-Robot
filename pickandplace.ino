//Detect base colour when starting off 

//Start moving towards arena

//Encounter a ball

//-- Scan colour --

//if (colour == red) {
//  avoidance action
//}

// pick up non-red ball 

//return back to base 
// -this could be done by remembering the starting coordinates of the robot 
// -once a ball is firmly in hands then just go back and look for its coloured base by searching 

//once reaching the base, drop the ball into the base 

//repeat (this would probably be in a while loop)

//don't know how to make it stop (maybe set a 20min timer where the robot just automatically stops moving)
